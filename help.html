  <h2>Introduction</h2>

  <p class="text">
    First and foremost, this application has been hacked together
    during evenings after regular work and I did not want to spend
    more time than necessary on it, so it probably contains design
    problems as well as plain bugs.  Fixing them might require I
    delete data stored in the application.  Second, this site is
    hosted
    on <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/">Google App
    Enginne</a> as a free app, which means it is subject to various
    <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas">quotas
    </a>. If all users collectively exceeded any of the quotas, the
    application will most likely be unusable and data stored in it can
    become inaccessible for up to a day.  On top of it, Google does not
    give any guarantees and neither do I.  Therefore, <b>please make sure
    that you back up any valuable data you enter into this application</b>
    (see section on <a href="#importexport">export</a>.  If you don't you
    might loose it or not be able to access it and it will be entirely your
    fault.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    The concept of this application is simple.  You enter foreign words or
    short phrases into it along with description so that the application
    might give you a test, showing you only the description and requesting
    that you enter the word or phrase.  The words are divided into sets and
    the application always tests your knowledge of one set at a time,
    asking for words in random order.  You successfully finish a set test
    if you enter each word correctly twice as many times as incorrectly or
    at least twice in case you never get it wrong.
  </p>

  <a name="mainpage"></a>
  <h2>Main page</h2>

  <p class="text">
    Main page only lists your test sets.  You can create one by simply
    entering its name and pressing the button "Create new set."  You can
    also run a test on a particular set from this page by pressing the
    "Test" button associated with a particular set but you obviously need
    to add some words to your set.  Click on the name of a set to get to
    its page where you can do that and much more.
  </p>

  <a name="testsetpage"></a>
  <h2>Test set page</h2>

  <p class="text">
    The set page lists all words you have entered so far, together with
    their abbreviated description, number of correct and incorrect answers,
    status, and link to edit, reset, or delete a particular word.
    Resetting a word means that its counters of incorrect and correct
    answers are set to zero.  Any edit of a word will have the same effect.
    You can add a new word using the simple form at the bottom of the page
    (there is a section on <a href="#spanishaccents">entering Spanish
    accents</a> below).
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    Please be reasonable when entering words, don't try anything too fancy
    or outright malicious, if you stretch it, it might break... probably
    only for you which won't give me much incentive to fix it ;-) Also note
    that while there is no theoretical limit on the number of words in a
    single set, the test will only run on the first 300 active ones.
    Personally, I usually create sets of 30-40 words.  Remember to backup
    your data when they grow large.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    The buttons in a row above the listing allow you to run a test of this
    set, give the current set a different name, import and export words
    from a CSV (see a separate <a href="#importexport">section on import
    and export</a>), reset all words in a set, or delete the whole set.
    Deleting a set deletes all words stored in it without any way of
    recovering them.  Backup your data when they grow large.
  </p>

  <h2>Entering Spanish accents</h2> 

  <p class="text">
    This application has been written primarily to help me, my family and
    friends learn Spanish vocabulary and therefore it has some limited and
    clumsy support for typing Spanish accented letters on US keyboards.
    You can enter any accented vowel by typing the vowel followed by either
    a single quote ('), equality sign ("="), or plus ("+").  Similarly, if
    you want to enter ñ, type a simple n followed by any of the three
    special characters.  In order to type ü, type u followed by a double
    quote.  Of course, if your layout allows for direct typing of these
    characters (e.g. keyboards on phones with a touchscreen), you do not
    have to use these workarounds.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    Note that this feature is implemented by some dubious JavaScript, which
    is a language which I do not really know and which I abhor.  Therefore
    it is entirely possible it will not work 100% or will have some weird
    unintended consequences (see section on <a href="#bugs">bugs</a> if you
    encounter something like this).
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    There is no reason why you can't use this application to learn any
    other language (or to memorize anything at all, actually), but if the
    language has characters which can't be easily typed on your keyboard,
    you'll have to be switching keyboard layouts.
  </p>
  
  <a name="importexport"></a>
  <h2>Importing and exporting</h2>

  <p class="text">
    If you press the "Export" button on a test set page, you'll be offered
    to download all the words in the current set as a CSV (comma separated
    values) file, which is a simple format which you should be able to open
    in any spreadsheet editor such
    as <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google
    Drive</a>, <a href="http://www.libreoffice.org/">LibreOffice</a>, or
    Microsoft Office.  You can also look at it in any plain text viewer.
    The format of the CSV file is simple.  One word per row (line).  In the
    first column (field) there is the word itself and all other columns
    contain the description, one line of the description each.  The CSV you
    import or export is supposed to be in UTF8 unicode.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    <b>If you use export for backup, please at least briefly check that the
    generated file contains all the words and descriptions before you
    consider the backup successful!</b>  Because it is a simple download,
    the exporting machinery does not do error handling very robustly.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    When you press the "Import" button on a test set page you'll be
    presented with a page asking you where to import from.  You can either
    upload a file from your local computer or have the CSV data downloaded
    from a URL link.  In both cases, the data is expected to be in the same
    format as above (one word per line, the word itself in the first field,
    description lines in all the others).
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    The URL option is mainly intended to be used
    with <a href="https://drive.google.com/">Google Drive</a>.  If you have
    a spreadsheet in there with words you want to import, click
    "File"-&gt;"Publish to the web" in the menu.  First, click on "Start
    publishing."  Then select CSV format in the section "Get a link to the
    published data" the lower half of the window. Then copy the generated
    URL from the text area below to the vocabulary application and hit
    "Import from URL."  Words from your spreadsheet will be imported to the
    current set.  Moreover, you can send this link to another user of this
    application and he can import them too!
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    Please be reasonable and careful when importing words, don't try
    anything fancy or outright malicious.  Again, if you stretch the
    application, it might break, probably only for you which won't give me
    much incentive to fix it ;-) Also note that while there is no
    theoretical limit on the number of words in a single set, the test will
    only run on the first 300 active ones.  Importing huge data sets might
    also deplete Google App
    Engine <a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas">quotas
    </a>, rendering the application unusable for everybody.  Above all,
    please make sure you never import garbage.
  </p>

  <a name="testing"></a>
  <h2>Testing</h2>

  <p class="text">
    Hitting "Test" button on the main page or test set page runs the test.
    The application will present you with the description of a word and you
    are requested to type the word.  Then the application tells you whether
    you were right or wrong, gives the correct answer and presents you with
    another description.  Repeatedly, until you finish the test set.  You
    can interrupt testing of a set and come back any time without loosing
    your results so far, as long as you do not reset a word or set
    (see <a href="#testsetpage">test set page section</a> for more on
    resetting).
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    Of course, you can use <a href="#spanishaccents">clumsy tricks to enter
    Spanish accents</a> when entering the word into a test.
  </p>

  <h2>Bugs, Wishes...</h2>

  <p class="text">
    While I wrote this software hoping that it will be useful and intend to
    use it often myself.  The nature of its speedy development means that
    there certainly are quite a few bugs.  If you encounter one, please report
    it (with a detailed description of the nature of the problem and steps how
    to reproduce it)
    using <a href="http://github.com/jamborm/mjvocabulary/issues">http://github.com/jamborm/mjvocabulary/issues</a>.
    Unfortunately, I will often be unable to fix the problems in a timely
    manner.  After all, this is my hobby, not my job.  On the other hand, bugs
    that annoy me too will be fixed soon, I suppose :-)
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    If you want to have a feature added, you can send me an email too but
    don't hold your breath, I will probably too busy or lazy to implement it
    anytime soon.  Alternatively, you can try and implement it yourself, the
    source code and an interface to submit a git pull request is at
    <a href="http://github.com/jamborm/mjvocabulary">http://github.com/jamborm/mjvocabulary</a>
    too.
  </p>

  <p class="text">
    I hope you'll find the application useful and fun to use.  Happy
    testing!
  </p>
